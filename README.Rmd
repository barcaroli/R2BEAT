# R2BEAT: Multistage Sample Design 

Multivariate optimal allocation for different domains in one and two stages stratified sample design. R2BEAT extends the Neyman (1934)  – Tschuprow (1923) allocation method to the case of several variables, adopting a generalization of the Bethel’s proposal (1989). R2BEAT develops this methodology but, moreover, it allows to determine the sample allocation in the multivariate and multi-domains case of estimates for two-stage stratified samples. It also allows to perform Primary Stage Units selection.
